# Enum
An enum is a data structure that declares its different subtypes. It enables the same functionality as a `struct`, but it does so with less code. 

The syntax for defining variants resembles the syntaxes used to define structs: you can have **variants with no data** (like unit-like structs), **variants with named data**, and **variants with unnamed data** (like tuple structs).

## Defining an Enum
```rust
enum Color{
    red, green, blue,
}
```

Following the above definition, we can create instances of each of the three variants of `Color` with:
```rust
let red = Color::red;
let green = Color::green;
let blue = Color::blue;
```

## Associate data with type
One advantage of using Enum is that we can associate data and type in one definition. 

```rust
struct RGB(i32, i32, i32);

enum Color{
    red(String),
    green(Vec<i32>),
    blue(RGB),
}
```
Now we can attach data to each variant of the enum directly, e.g., `let r = Color::red(String::from("#FF0000"))`.

The data types in Enum are flexible, **each variant can have different types and amounts of associated data**. Red color can have a string value "#FF0000", while `green` color a vector `vec![0, 128, 0]` to represent its data. 

Note that, this is a simplified example to demonstrate how to associate data with its type in Enum, do not write it that way in actual code.


## Compare with struct
- just like `struct`, we can also define methods on enums. Hereâ€™s a method named `change` that we could define on our `Color` enum:
```rust
impl Color{
    fn change(&self) { 
        // method body
    }
}
```
The body of the method would use self to get the value that we called the method on.


## The `option` Enum
`option` is an enum defined by the standard library, it encodes a common scenario in which a value could be **something or it could be nothing**. 
```rust
enum Option<T> {
    None, 
    Some<T>,
}
```
`Some<T>` means the `Some` variant of the `Option` enum can hold one piece of data of any type. Here are some examples of using `Option` values to hold number types and string types:
```rust
let n = Some(5);
let s = Some("Some string");
let absent: Option<i32> = None;
```

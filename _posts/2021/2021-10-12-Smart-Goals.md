Implementing a plan requires perseverance, determination and a good strategy, making a plan requires a smart mind. A great plan will pay you back twice as much with half the effort.





**SMART** is an acronym that can be used to guide your goal setting.
Its criteria is usually attributed to Peter Drucker's concept of goal management. The first known usage of the term appeared in a management review written by George T. Doran in November 1981. Since then, Professor Robert S. Rubin (St. Louis University) has written an article on SMART in an article for the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology. He says SMART means different things to different people, as follows:

- **S**pecific, or simple, significant, sensible.
- **M**easuable, or meaningful, motivating.
- **A**chievable, or agreed, attainable.
- **R**elevant, or reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based.
- **T**ime-bound, or time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive.
Some authors have expanded it to include extra focus areas; SMARTER, for example, includes **E**valuated and **R**eviewed.

## Specific
Your goal should be clear and specific, otherwise you won't be able to focus or feel truly motivated to achieve it. When drafting your goal, try to answer the five "W" questions:

- **What** do I want to accomplish?
- **Why** is this goal important?
- **Who** is involved?
- **Where** is it located?
- **Which** resources or limits are involved?

### Example

Imagine that you are currently a junior NLP software engineer, and you'd like to become a senior. A specific goal could be, "I want to gain the skills and experience necessary to become a senior NLP engineer within 1 year, so that I am qualified to complete relevant projects independently."

## Measuable

It's important to have measurable goals so that you can track your progress and stay motivated. Assessing progress helps you stay focused, complete tasks on time, and feel the excitement of getting closer to achieving your goals.

A measurable goal should address questions such as:

- How much work need to do?
- What percentage of tasks are completed? 10% or 5%?

### Example

You might measure your goal of acquiring the skills to become a senior NLP engineer, you will have completed the necessary training courses and gained the relevant experience within bounded time. Again, the concept of relevant experience is vague. A clearer but perhaps less reasonable goal would be to complete 40 blog posts and complete 6 small projects within a year.

## Achievable
Your goal also needs to be **realistic and attainable** to be successful. In other words, it should stretch your abilities but still remain possible. When you set an achievable goal, you may be able to identify previously overlooked opportunities or resources that can bring you closer to it.

### Example
Whether is it possible to develop the skills required to become a senior NLP engineer within a limited time, based on your existing experience and qualifications. Or, do you have the time to complete the required training effectively? Are the necessary resources available to you? Can you afford to do it?


## Result-based
This step is about ensuring that what you've planned align with your goal. Make sure what you do will guide you forward towards your goal, not somewhere else. 

### Example
To become a NLP engineer, it is better to gain skills, read books and watch video tutorials in filds like Python, Machine Learning and Math.


## Time-bounded
Every goal needs a target date, so that you have a deadline to focus on and something to work toward. This part of the SMART goal criteria helps to prevent everyday tasks from taking priority over your longer-term goals.

A time-bound goal will usually answer these questions:
- What can I do six months from now?
- What can I do six weeks from now?
- What can I do today?

### Example
Gaining the skills to become a senior NLP engineer, as we mentioned earlier. How long will it take you to acquire these skills? Do you need further training, so that you're eligible for certain exams or qualifications? It's important to give yourself a realistic time frame for accomplishing the smaller goals that are necessary to achieving your final objective.

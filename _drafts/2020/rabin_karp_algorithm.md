[Rabin-Karp algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm) is a string-searching algorithm created by Richard M. Karp and Michael O. Rabin (1987).

While iterating over a target text, this algorithm efficiently encodes its substrings into numbers, and takes only constant time to compare each substring with the pattern. More specifically, it uses a [rolling hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_hash) to quickly filter out positions of the text that can not match the pattern, and then checks for a match at the remaining positions. Generalizations of the same idea can be used to find more than one match of a single pattern, or to find matches for more than one pattern.

# A bird-view
Pseudocode of Rabin-Karp algorithm:

```python
1 def rabin_karp(s[1..n]: string, pattern[1..m]:string)
2     hpattern := hash(pattern[1..m])
3     for i in range(1, n-m+2)
4        hs = hash(s[i..i+m-1])
5        if hs = hpattern
6            if s[i..i+m-1] = pattern[1..m]
7                return i
8    return not_found
```

For such algorithm, lines 2, 4, and 6 each require `O(m)` time. However, line 2 is only executed once, and line 6 is only executed if the hash values match, which is unlikely to happen more than a few times. Line 5 is executed `O(n)` times, but each comparison only requires constant time, so its impact is `O(n)`. The issue is line 4.

To calculate the hash value of substring `s[i..i+m-1]`, a naive method requires `O(m)` time if the value is calculated by examining each character. Then an algorithm with a naive hash computation method requires `O(mn)` time, the same complexity as a straightforward string matching algorithm. 

To speed up the algorithm, the hash must be computed in **constant time**. The trick is to reuse the previously calculated hash value of `s[i+1..i+m-1]` when computing the next hash value of `s[i+1..i+m]`, which is possible with a **rolling hash**, providing us the ability to calculate the hash values without rehashing the whole string.

## Trivial Hash Function Won't Work

A trivial rolling hash function simply accumulate the values of each character from the substring, e.g., `h(s[0..m-1]) = sum(h(s[0]) + ... + h(s[m]))`. However, this function suffers a severe drawback: it generates a same value for different substrings, e.g., `h(ab) = h(ba)`. Thus, an algorithm equipped with this function results in frequent comparisons on line 6.

Since each comparison requires `O(m)` time to do character-to-character examination, the whole algorithm then takes a worst-case `O(mn)` time.

# More Sophisticated Rolling Hash

The [Rabin fingerprinting scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin_fingerprint) conducts rehashing with the following formula:

$$ H(s[i+1..i+n]) = ( ( ( H( s[i..n] ) - s[i] * base ) * d ) + s[i+n] + q) \% q $$

where 
* `s` is the text string.
* `q` is a prime modulus to avoid overflow 
* `n` is the length of pattern string.
* `base`, base offset. 
    * This method treats every substring as a number in some base, therefore, `base` should be large enough to avoid frequent hash collision. Usually be $$ d^ {(n-1)} $$, where $$ d = 256 $$ is the number of characters in the alphabet.

This function reduce the number of hash value collisions of strings with same counts of characters, e.g., `ab` v.s. `ba`.

Question: Could collisions be completely avoided ? 

Ans: **No**, if we adopt an implementation where hash values are calculated by modulating a prime number `q`, then outputs are constrained by `q`, which is finite. Since we have infinite input strings, and the length of string is unbounded, collision is unavoidable (very much like the case of MD5 method).


## How the above formula come ?
Let's put the prime modulus aside for a moment, and consider the hash values of strings with length `n`. 
For better readability, we write $$h(0, i)$$ as the hash value of string `s[0..i]` (inclusive on both ends) and `s[i]` the numeric value of character `s[i]`, then: 

1. $$h(0, 0) = s[0]$$, 
2. $$h(0, 1) = h(0, 0) * d + s[1]$$, 
3. ...
4. $$h(0, n-1) = h(0, n-2) * d + s[n-1]$$, 

Then 

$$\begin{eqnarray}
h(0, n-1) &=& h(0, n - 2) * d + s[n-1] \\
          &=& (h(0, n-3) * d + s[n-2]) * d + s[n-1] \\
          &=& h(0, n-3) * d^2 + s[n-2] * d + s[n-1] \\
          &=& h(0, n-4) * d^3 + s[n-3] * d^2 + s[n-2] * d + s[n-1] \\
          &=& ...\\
          &=& s[0] * d ^ {n-1} + s[1] * d ^ {n-2} + ... + s[n-1]
\end{eqnarray}$$

Similarly, we can calculate

$$\begin{eqnarray}
    h(1, n) &=& s[1] * d ^ {n-1} + ... + s[n-1] * d + s[n]
\end{eqnarray}$$

Combine the above two formula, we have 

$$ h(1, n) = (h(0, n-1) - s[0] * d ^ {n-1}) * d + s[n] $$

The constant value $$d^{n-1}$$ is exactly our base offset.

# Implementation 
```python
def rabin_karp(s: string, pat: string):
    '''Implementation of Rabin-Karp Algorithm to find all occurrence
    of pat in s.
    '''
    m, n = len(s), len(pat)
    h_pat = 0  # Hash value for pat
    h_sub = 0  # Hash value for substring (with length n) of s
    MOD = 1000_000_007  # A prime number serves as modulus
    base = 233  # Base offset, which equals pow(d, n-1) % prime_modulus

    # To avoid overflowing integer maximums when the pattern string is longer,
    # the pattern length base offset is pre-calculated in a loop, modulating
    # the result each iteration
    def quick_pow(base, len, offset):
        ans, prod = 1, base
        while len:
            if len & 1: ans = ans * prod % MOD 
            prod = prod * prod % MOD 
            len >>= 1
        return ans 
    
    offset = quick_pow(base, n - 1)
    # for i in range(n - 1):
    #     base_offset = (base_offset * d) % prime_modulus

    # Calculate the hash value of pattern
    for i in range(n):
        h_pat = (base * h_pat + ord(pat[i])) % MOD 


    results = [] # Indexes of pat occurring in s 
    for i in range(m):
        if i >= n:
            h_sub += MOD - ord(s[i]) * offset % MOD 
        h_sub = (base * h_sub + ord(s[i])) % MOD 
        
        if h_pat == h_sub and pat == s[i:i + n]:
            results.append(i)
        
    return results
```

## Spurious Hit
A **spurious hit** is a case when the hash value of the pattern matches with the hash value of a window of the text but the window is not the actual pattern. This is unavoidable because the hash function maps infinite inputs into finite outputs.

Spurious hit increases the time complexity as the more spurious hits we have, the more comparisons are required. A typical way to reduce spurious hit is to increase the modulus MOD.

[Tarjan's algorith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm) ([source paper](http://langevin.univ-tln.fr/cours/PAA/extra/Tarjan-1972.pdf)) is an algorithm in graph theory for finding the **strongly connected components**(SCC) of a directed graph. It runs in linear time, `O(|E| + |V|)`.

The key idea used is that **nodes of strongly connected component form a subtree in the DFS spanning tree of the graph**.

The algorithm conducts a **depth-first search (DFS)** begins from an arbitrary start node (and subsequent depth-first searches are conducted on any nodes that have not yet been found). As usual with depth-first search, the search visits every node of the graph exactly once, declining to revisit any node that has already been visited. Thus, the collection of search trees is a spanning forest of the graph.

# Algorithm 
As mentioned in above, the key idea is utilizing the property that nodes of strongly connected component form a subtree in the DFS spanning tree of the graph.

The steps involved are: 
* Maintaining two arrays `low[u], disc[u]`, where `disc[u]` stores the value of the counter when a node `u` is visited for the first time, and `low[u]` the topmost reachable ancestor (with minimum possible `disc` value).

* Nodes are pushed onto a stack once they're visited 

* The unexplored children of a node are explored, `disc[u]` and `low[u]` is accordingly updated

* When we encounter a node with `low[u] == disc[u]`, we found a entry node of a SCC and all the nodes above it in the stack are popped out and assigned the appropriate SCC number

# Complexity 
* Time: the algorithm is built upon DFS and therefore, each node is visited once and only once. For each node, we perform some constant amount of work and iterate over its adjacency list. Thus, the complexity is `O(|V|+ |E|)`
* Space: the depth of recursion and the size of stack can be at most `n` nodes, thus `O(|V|)`

# Example
The above graph contains 3 SCCs, `[1, 2, 3], [4], [5, 6, 7, 8]`.

A Tarjan's algorithm first visit node `1`, `low[1], disc[1]` are set to 1 and node 1 is pushed to stack

Then node 3 is visited, `low[3], disc[3]` are set to 2 and node 3 is pushed to stack

Then node 4 is visited, `low[4], disc[4]` are set to 3 and node 4 is pushed to stack

Then node 5 is visited, `low[5], disc[5]` are set to 4 and node 5 is pushed to stack

Then node 6 is visited, `low[6], disc[6]` are set to 5 and node 6 is pushed to stack


<img src="https://i.loli.net/2020/06/10/Oj2hnKJRbl8ZXw1.png" width="350px" alt="visit node 6">

Then node 7 is visited, `low[7], disc[7]` are set to 6 and node 7 is pushed to stack

Then node 8 is visited, `low[8], disc[8]` are set to 7 and node 8 is pushed to stack. 

And by `DFS`, node 8's child node has a lower disc value, i.e., `disc[5] == 4`, then `low[8]` is updated to `4`, and the `low` values of node 8's ancestors are updated accordingly until we go back to node `5` again.

For node 5, `low[5] == disc[5]`, which means we have found the entry-node (first node) of a SCC, and all nodes from node 4 to the top of current stack together form a SCC.

And then we go back to node 4, finding that `low[4] == disc[4]`, node 4 is therefore popped up and forms a SCC by itself.

`low[2] = disc[2]` are updated to 8. Owing to node 1, `low[2]` is updated to 1, so does `low[3]`, and `low[1]` which already equals to `1`. All the remaining nodes in the stack forms the third SCC.

Word Cloud is a data visualization technique to represent text data by the frequency or importance of each word.
Significant textual data points can be highlighted using a word cloud. Word clouds are widely used for analyzing data from social network websites. 

To generate a word cloud, the following modules are required:
```python
from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import pandas as pd # pandas is optional 
```

# Producing wordcloud for movie subtitles
We are going to visualize the film [Gentlemen](https://movie.douban.com/subject/30211998/) by investigating its subtitle, which can be found [here](https://www.yts-subtitle.com/subtitles/thegentlemen20191080pwebripdd51x264-cm-15925).

## Removing stop words
Step 1: we need to remove `stopwords`: which are presumed to be uninformative in representing the content of a text, such as `a`, `an`, `the`. The `wordcloud` module provides a list of stop words (counts: 192) in [`wordcloud.STOPWORDS`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amueller/word_cloud/master/wordcloud/stopwords). 
Another stop word option is `nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english')`, which contains 179 words. 

These two lists work fine in most cases, but not so good for texts built solely from conversations, such as subtitles from a film where dialogs contain lots of words that are not closely related to the film theme or topics. For example, we find that `know` and `now` occur frequently in the dialogs, but none of them carry much information about what is happening in that film. 

Thus, we've crafted our own stop word list. [This list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/117ami/117ami.github.io/master/materials/stopwords.txt) contains 1527 words that are frequently adopted in daily conversations, but cause very few information loss when removed.

Now we can insert the following lines into our code whenever a longer list of stop words is necessary.

```python
import requests
stopwords = requests.get( \
    'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/117ami/117ami.github.io/master/materials/stopwords.txt'\
        ).text.split('\n')
```

## Generate word cloud
```python
title_file = 'gentlemen.txt'
wordcloud = WordCloud(width = 1600, height = 800, 
                background_color ='black', 
                stopwords = stopwords, 
                min_font_size = 10
                ).generate(' '.join(open(title_file, 'r').readlines()))
  
# plot the WordCloud image                        
plt.figure(figsize = (16, 12), facecolor = None) 
plt.imshow(wordcloud) 
plt.axis("off") 
plt.tight_layout(pad = 0) 
plt.show() 
```

And here comes the word cloud of **Gentlemen**, or `fuckman` if we combine the top two most significant word shown in the image.

## Add Custom Mask
Keep in mind the background of the image used must be white, otherwise, the system will consider the background as an object.

We need to add some dependencies to load the image.
```python
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
```

Next, enter the path of the font into the parameters.
```python
mask = np.array(Image.open('path/to/image'))
wc = WordCloud(stopwords=STOPWORDS, 
               mask=mask, background_color="white",
               max_words=2000, max_font_size=256,
               random_state=42, width=mask.shape[1],
               height=mask.shape[0])

wc.generate(article_text)
plt.imshow(wc, interpolation="bilinear")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

And the result is 
<img src='https://i.loli.net/2020/06/17/fCH5TZYy6QslPx4.png' width='500px'>

We can also generate color based on the mask. We will need the functions provided by the wordcloud library.
```python
from wordcloud import ImageColorGenerator
wc = WordCloud(..., color_func=ImageColorGenerator(mask))
```
